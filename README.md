# Friendfinder

* The purpose of this project is to query users with a survey to test their compatability
  against other users who have previously taken the survey. 

## How it works

* Answer the survey questions as honestly as possible
  * They will ask you how much you agree or disagree with the questions' statements
* Copy a link to your Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, or other social network's profile picture.
  * This will let your new friends know what you look like, and vice-versa!
